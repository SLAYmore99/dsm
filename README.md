Q 1: Write a program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET:
a) ismember (a, A): check whether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false.
b) powerset A): list all the elements of power set of A.

Q 2: Create a class SET and take two sets as input from user to perform following SET Operations:
a) Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not.
b) Union and Intersection of two Sets.
c) Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.
d) Set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two SETS.
e) Cartesian Product of Sets.

Q 3: Write a Program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion.

Q 4: Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to check if a relation is reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a program to use this class.

Q 5: Write a program to check whether the given relation is:
a) Equivalent, or
b) Partial Order relation, or
c) None

Q 6: Write a Program to generate the Fibonacci Series using recursion.

Q 7: Write a Program to store a function (polynomial/exponential), and then evaluate the polynomial, (For example store f (x) = 4n^3 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f (5)).

Q 8: Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition. (For example, if the given set is {1, 2}, the permutations are 12 and 21). 

Q 9: Write a program to accept an input n from the user and graphically represent the values of  T(n) where n varies from 0 to n for the recurrence relations. For e.g. T(n) = T(n-1) + n, T(0) = 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2, T(0) =1, T(n) = 2*T(n)/2 + n, T(1)=1.
